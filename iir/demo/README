This demo directory shows how filters are set up, how data is
processed sample by sample and how the frequency responses
look like with the help of python scripts.

Impulse responses and spectra of different filters:
./iirdemo
python3 plot_impulse_fresponse.py

50Hz removal and lowpass filtering:
./ecg50hzfilt
python3 plot_ecg_filt.py
